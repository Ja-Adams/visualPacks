# visualPacks
HTML/ReactJS test

This app will make use of HTML and Javascript to show Magic the Gathering packs from a cube list (a self made collection of cards).
The end goal will be to have software I can freely use with friends to create drafted decks and make use of this custom environment, like easily bundling pairs of cards together
